NOTAR system uses two thruster systems: one simulates the coanda effect of the tailboom using the input of collective,
the other thrusters simulate the directional thrust at the end of the tailboom.

Inertia and CoG should be correct, inertia calculated from Ec135 which has nearly the same size and weight

rotor data should be correct, but blade weight and controll movement range needed


####Very important!!!####
The whole rotorcraft pilot manuals and maintenance manuals are free avaliable in the web

But for little cash around 200-300 Dollars you can get a legal copy at MD helicopters after registration!

####3d-model###
Actually it is a MD-902 Explorer, a 20cm longer version of the basic MD-900.
Made in Skecthup it is really very detailed and very accurate!!
Unfortunately it isn't very optimized, lots of unneeded vertices, double faces, edges etc...
While the exterior model had a fast bit of cleaning up, the interior needs some love.
Mapping and texturing is a real pain- maybe it is better to dump the interior model and create a new one 

included the blend-file for Blender 2.49 , especially for those who didn't upgraded to Blender 2.6x
###Rating####
decided to give 3 stars for the 3d-model though lacking animations due to accurate and detailed 3d-model

####To-Do:####
FDM:

-finetune airfoil so it will match climb rates and true airspeeds
-make simulated NOTAR-systems only work depending on rotors rpm/ downwash (Nasal?...)

3d-model:

-3d-model optimization again, and again, and again....
-liveries - Done
-instruments, switches and all the stuff - Pending
-rotor - Pending
-animation: doors, NOTAR thrust noozle, rudders, wiper - Pending
-additional things like winch, wirecutters, emergency floats - Done

Systems:

-more correct fuel system
-systems: electrical, hydraulics, oil pressure....

Sound:
-everything
